2017 UK Parliamentary general election

"Data were collected from (Acting) Returning Officers, Electoral Registration Officers and the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland."
Data fields for Postal Votes are prescribed in the legislation (Form K).
Where a cell is blank this is because the relevant data was not available and/or was not returned.
Sub-categories of postal vote rejection may not add up to the total number rejected due to inconsistencies in some data returns or issues with the form.
Sub-categories of rejected ballot papers may not add up to the total number rejected due to inconsistencies in some data returns. 
Inconsistencies between electoral registration applications and additions may be due to the timing some applications were submitted (before the time period covered in the data fields).
"Due to issues with electoral management software, data for fields 8 - 14, 16, and 27 - 29 on the additional data form are less complete and have been published at an aggregate level only. A detailed breakdown is available on request. 
"
Other inconsistencies with the data may also be due to issues in generating the data from the electoral management software.
