# Using APIs

This folder contains resources on working with APIs. That includes:

* An [introduction to the JSON format and how to grab items from within it](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7373-Data-Journalism/blob/master/api/jsonintro.md)
* An [R Markdown file explaining how to work with an API in R](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7373-Data-Journalism/blob/master/api/usingpostcodesapi.Rmd)
* [This R Markdown file explains how to use the data.police API to fetch the latest month of reported crimes on campuses](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7373-Data-Journalism/blob/master/mapping/crimeapi.Rmd)
* A [tutorial on fetching data from an API in JavaScript using jQuery](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7373-Data-Journalism/blob/master/api/javascriptapi.md)
* You might also want to try [this guide to JSON including exercise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON) at MDN
* This [guide to tree structures](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/all-you-need-to-know-about-tree-data-structures-bceacb85490c) is quite useful for understanding JSON (among other things). You can skip/ignore the code part which is in Python (we cover that next semester)
