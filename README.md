## Module Synopsis

Data Journalism aims to facilitate a flexible and adaptable skillset, including the use of ‘computational thinking’, that provides a basis for you to critically adapt to both new and existing data journalism techniques.

The module begins by building applied understanding of data journalism techniques and issues, before exploring more specific practices around design, analysis and coding. These are closely aligned to the core assignment tasks. A range of newsgathering and storytelling techniques are explored, giving you the basis for initiating and developing contemporary data journalism projects within a professional context.

You will also be learning about other aspects of data journalism in sister modules, for example [the **Storytelling Techniques** module](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7334-Narrative/blob/master/README.md) will give you a range of skills for telling data-driven stories using video, audio, visual journalism, visualisation, and interactivity. In **Research in Practice** you will explore research around newsrooms. In **Specialist Reporting, Investigations and Coding** you will expand your coding and investigative skills, and in **Law, ethics, regulation and security** you will build your understanding of legal and security issues in the field.


## Learning outcomes

1. Identify, gather and communicate stories based on structured information using data journalism techniques and technologies for an identified audience
2.	Critically evaluate the professional, legal and ethical contexts surrounding data journalism and apply that to a specific project

## Week by week outline

This module begins with formal classes and becomes more student-driven as it progresses. You will be expected to **experiment with techniques ahead of sessions**, so that class time is spent more fruitfully in interactive discussion rather than one-way lectures.

You will also be expected to feed your own experiences into each class - and your own problems and questions - rather than coming to the sessions with nothing to contribute or build on. As independent learners the emphasis is on you to drive your learning forward through conversation rather than accept it passively.

## 1: Data journalism: it starts with an idea

By the end of this week you should be able to describe what data journalism is, and what types of stories you can find and tell with data journalism techniques. You should be able to generate ideas for data journalism stories yourself, and identify some sources of data.
